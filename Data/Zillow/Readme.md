How to interpret the Heat Index data
The metric assumes an index value typically ranging from 0-100. A higher value indicates the market is more tilted in favor of sellers. 

We consider: 

A score of 70 or above to be a “strong sellers market.” 
A score from 55 to 69 to be a “sellers market.”
A score from 44 to 55 to be a “neutral market.” 
A score from 28 to 44 to be a “buyers market.”
A score of 27 or below to be a “strong buyers market.” 
While the range of these numbers is somewhat arbitrary, the relation of these indexes gives us information about how a given market compares to others, or to itself in the past, in terms of “temperature.” For example, we can make the following comparisons with the current metric:

Region A has a higher temperature than region B, so region A has more buyer competition than B and market balance is therefore tilted more in favor of sellers.
Region A is up 10% month over month, indicating the competition in the region is increasing. This suggests there are more potential buyers per available listing than the previous month.
Region A is down 5% year over year, indicating that compared to last year it is slightly easier to buy a home.
